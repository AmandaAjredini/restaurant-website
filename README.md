# Steakhouse Web Site
This was my very first website, designed for a steakhouse restaurant.

It provides essential details to customers about the restaurant such as its location with a map, opening hours, event advertisements, menus, FAQ's and supplier information.

I created a booking reservation system dynamically using JavaScript and used CSS to make the web site user-friendly and attractive.
I created the menus using Canva and linked them to the web site to make the web site more informative for potentially dining customers.
I integrated Bootstrap framework and made use of the 'carousel' feature for an engaging visual experience.

This project showcases my early skills in web design and development.
